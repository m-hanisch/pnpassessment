    "keywords": "Microsoft 365 Assessment Tool Microsoft 365 SharePoint Assessment tool is an open source community tool that provides customers with data to help them with various deprecation and adoption scenarios. This tool is currently under development/testing, more features and especially more documentation will be added soon. Getting started üöÄ Minimal steps to run: Download the assessment tool for the OS you're using. Assessment tool versions can be found in the releases folder Use the Assessment tool CLI to operate it: microsoft365-assessment.exe --help will show the available commands Common CLI calls are: Task CLI Start a new Syntex assessment (application permissions) for a complete tenant microsoft365-assessment.exe start --mode syntex --authmode application --tenant bertonline.sharepoint.com --applicationid c545f9ce-1c11-440b-812b-0b35217d9e83 --certpath \"My|CurrentUser|b133d1cb4d19ce539986c7ac67de005481084c84\" Start a new Syntex full assessment (delegated permissions) for a set of site collections microsoft365-assessment.exe start --mode Syntex --authmode interactive --tenant bertonline.sharepoint.com --siteslist \"https://bertonline.sharepoint.com/sites/prov-1,https://bertonline.sharepoint.com/sites/temp2\" --syntexfull List all the assessments microsoft365-assessment.exe list Realtime status update of the running assessments microsoft365-assessment.exe status Pause a running assessment microsoft365-assessment.exe pause --id <assessment id> Restart a paused or terminated assessment microsoft365-assessment.exe restart --id <assessment id> Generate PowerBI report (includes CSV export) microsoft365-assessment.exe report --id <assessment id> Export the gathered data to CSV microsoft365-assessment.exe report --id <assessment id> --mode CsvOnly --path <location to put CSV files> Setting up your Azure AD application The assessment tool requires Azure AD based authentication and supports application permissions (app-only) and delegated (user) permissions. Application permissions is the recommended approach as this way the assessment tool does have guaranteed access to all the sites in your tenant. If you use delegated permissions than you can either use the Interactive mode or the Device authentication mode. Device mode works on all OS's, including Linux as you authenticate the assessment tool from any device. Interactive will popup a browser session and ask you to authenticate. Application permissions require you to use a certificate for authentication and this certificate can be provided via a reference to a certificate in a local certificate store e.g. \"My|CurrentUser|b133d1cb4d19ce539986c7ac67de005481084c84\" or via providing a PFX file and password ( --certfile \"MyCertificate.pfx\" --certpassword *** ). If you don't specify the --applicationid argument the assessment tool will try to use the PnP Management Shell app (the one you use for PnP PowerShell ), but it's recommended to create a dedicated app for assessment as that way you can limit the permissions granted. Using PnP PowerShell this becomes really simple. Below cmdlet will create a new Azure AD application, will create a new self-signed certificate and will configure that cert with the Azure AD application. Finally the right permissions are configured and you're prompted to consent these permissions. # Ensure you replace contoso.onmicrosoft.com with your Azure AD tenant name # Ensure you replace joe@contoso.onmicrosoft.com with the user id that's an Azure AD admin (or global admin) # Sample for Syntex Register-PnPAzureADApp -ApplicationName Microsoft365AssessmentForSyntex ` -Tenant contoso.onmicrosoft.com ` -Store CurrentUser ` -GraphApplicationPermissions \"Sites.Read.All\" ` -SharePointApplicationPermissions \"Sites.FullControl.All\" ` -GraphDelegatePermissions \"Sites.Read.All\", \"User.Read\" ` -SharePointDelegatePermissions \"AllSites.Read\" ` -Username \"joe@contoso.onmicrosoft.com\" ` -Interactive # Sample for Workflow Register-PnPAzureADApp -ApplicationName Microsoft365AssessmentForWorkflow ` -Tenant contoso.onmicrosoft.com ` -Store CurrentUser ` -GraphApplicationPermissions \"Sites.Read.All\" ` -SharePointApplicationPermissions \"Sites.Manage.All\" ` -GraphDelegatePermissions \"Sites.Read.All\", \"User.Read\" ` -SharePointDelegatePermissions \"AllSites.Manage\" ` -Username \"joe@contoso.onmicrosoft.com\" ` -Interactive Permissions required The assessment tool aims to be able to perform the assessment task at hand using minimal read permissions, but for certain assessments not all features work when using minimal permissoins. Assessment Authentication Minimal Optimal Details Syntex Application Graph: Sites.Read.All, SharePoint: Sites.Read.All Graph: Sites.Read.All, SharePoint: Sites.FullControl.All When using the --syntexfull argument the assessment tool will use the search APIs to count how many documents use a given content type and how many retention labels there are applied on a list, and search in combination with application permissions requires Sites.FullControl.All. The assessment tool will also check if a library uses workflow 2013 and this requires the Sites.Manage.All or higher permission role Syntex Delegated Graph: Sites.Read.All, User.Read, SharePoint: AllSites.Read Graph: Sites.Read.All, User.Read, SharePoint: AllSites.Manage The assessment tool will check if a library uses workflow 2013 and this requires the AllSites.Manage or higher permission scope Workflow Application Graph: Sites.Read.All, SharePoint: Sites.Manage.All Graph: Sites.Read.All, SharePoint: Sites.Manage.All Workflow Delegated Graph: Sites.Read.All, User.Read, SharePoint: AllSites.Manage Graph: Sites.Read.All, User.Read, SharePoint: AllSites.Manage I want to help üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è If you want to join our team and help, then feel free to check the issue list for planned work or create an issue with sugggested improvements. Supportability and SLA üíÅüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è This tool is an open-source and community provided tool backed by an active community supporting it. This is not a Microsoft provided tool, so there's no SLA or direct support for this open-source component from Microsoft. Please report any issues using the issues list . FAQ Running on MacOS or Linux The assessment tool can be used on MacOS and Linux except the PowerBI report generation as the PowerBI client only is available for Windows. After copying the needed binary from the releases folder you need to mark the binary as executable via sudo chmod +x microsoft365-assessment . Once that's done you can use the assessment tool, the assessment tool binary itself contains all the needed depencies (including the .NET 6 runtime). If you later on want to generate a PowerBI report for an assessment ran on Linux of MacOS, you then can copy the scan output folder (guid = scan id, located in the folder containing the binary) to the folder on a Windows machine where you've put the Windows version of the assessment tool. When you then use microsoft365-assessment.exe report --id <assessment id> the report will be generated and opened in Power BI Desktop. Running on a GCC, GCC High, DoD or China tenant / running the assessment tool on a port different from 25025 The assessment tool can be used to run against tenants hosted in other cloud environments. Doing this requires the manual addition of a settings file named appsettings.json in the same folder as the assessment tool binary. Below are the sample settings for selecting another cloud environment: { \"PnPCore\": { \"Environment\": \"USGovernment\" }, \"CustomSettings\": { \"Port\": 7887 } } Valid values for environment are: Production , PreProduction , USGovernment (a.k.a GCC), USGovernmentHigh (a.k.a GCC High), USGovernmentDoD (a.k.a DoD), China and Germany . Next to the adding the appsettings.json file you also need to include the --environment argument when launching an assessment via the start command. The possible values are identical to the ones provided in the configuration file. When you for some reason port 25025 is occupied on your machine you can configure the assessment tool by providing an alternative port number via the appsettings.json file.
