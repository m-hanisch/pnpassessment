Download the latest version The Microsoft 365 Assessment tool versions are available via the GitHub releases page of the repository hosting the open source Microsoft 365 Assessment tool. There are three flavors of the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool, a Windows version, macOS version and Linux version. It's recommended to always use the latest version. When using the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool the tool outputs (reports, CSV files, logs) will be placed inside the folder containing the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool, hence it's recommended to put the downloaded Microsoft 365 Assessment tool somewhere inside a dedicated folder on your computer's file system. E.g. create a folder c:\\microsoft365assessment and copy the microsoft365-assessment.exe file in that folder. Version updates When you launch the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool it will check if there's a newer version and will notify you, downloading the newest version is a manual step and highly recommended whenever there is one. Is it safe to just run a downloaded executable The Microsoft 365 Assessment tool is an open source managed tool, but the release process is a Microsoft managed one. This means that tool changes are reviewed by Microsoft and that the shipped Windows versions of the tool are code signed by Microsoft, which prevents tampering with the binary file. Furthermore it's not required and therefore not recommended to run the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool using elevated privileges. Running on macOS and Linux After copying the needed binary from the releases folder you need to mark the binary as executable via sudo chmod +x microsoft365-assessment . Once that's done you can use the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool, the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool binary itself contains all the needed dependencies (including the .NET 6 runtime). While the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool can be used on macOS and Linux, there are some limitations on these platforms: the Power BI report generation will be skipped since Power BI Desktop is only is available for Windows. You however will be able to run an assessment and generate the needed CSV files containing the assessment results. If you later on want to generate the Power BI report for an assessment ran on Linux of macOS, you then can copy the assessment output folder (guid = assessment id, located in the folder containing the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool) to the folder on a Windows machine where you've put the Windows version of the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool. When you then use microsoft365-assessment.exe report --id <assessment id> the report will be generated and opened in Power BI Desktop."

    "keywords": "Configure authentication The Microsoft 365 Assessment tool uses Azure AD based authentication and requires a configured Azure AD application to run. The Microsoft 365 Assessment tool supports both application permissions (app-only) and delegated (user) permissions and various ways to authenticate. Important If you want the assessment tool to read all sites in your tenant then using application permissions is strongly recommended as that's the only way to guarantee that the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool can read all the sites. When you want to only assess a couple of sites and your account has permissions to these sites then using delegated permissions is an option. Setting up the Azure AD application A configured Azure AD application is a pre-requisite for using the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool. When you start an assessment you'll be able to specify the Azure AD application to use and how you want to authenticate. When you don't specify an Azure AD application when starting an assessment the PnP Management Shell application will be assumed, if you're using a recent PnP PowerShell version then this application most likely was setup. Note It's strongly recommended to create a dedicated Azure AD application so you can limit the needed permissions to what's needed by the module you're using in the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool. Permissions required The Microsoft 365 Assessment tool aims to be able to perform the assessment task at hand using minimal read permissions, but for certain assessments not all features work when using minimal permissions. To understand which Microsoft Graph and SharePoint permissions are required please checkout the authentication page of the respective modules. SharePoint Syntex adoption Creating an Azure AD application using PnP PowerShell Using PnP PowerShell creating an Azure AD application becomes really simple. Below cmdlet will create a new Azure AD application, will create a new self-signed certificate and will hookup that cert with the created Azure AD application. Finally the right permissions are configured and you're prompted to consent these permissions. Important If you encounter errors during below steps it's likely that you do not have the needed permissions. Please contact your tenant / Azure AD admins for help. # Sample for the SharePoint Syntex adoption module Register-PnPAzureADApp -ApplicationName Microsoft365AssessmentToolForSyntex ` -Tenant contoso.onmicrosoft.com ` -Store CurrentUser ` # Keep these if you want to use application permissions -GraphApplicationPermissions \"Sites.Read.All\" ` -SharePointApplicationPermissions \"Sites.FullControl.All\" ` # Keep these if you want to use delegated permissions -GraphDelegatePermissions \"Sites.Read.All\", \"User.Read\" ` -SharePointDelegatePermissions \"AllSites.Manage\" ` -Username \"joe@contoso.onmicrosoft.com\" ` -Interactive Note Replace contoso.onmicrosoft.com with your Azure AD tenant name and ensure you replace joe@contoso.onmicrosoft.com with the user id that's an Azure AD admin (or global admin)"
